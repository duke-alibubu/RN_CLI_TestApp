# Some Materials
## Blah Blah Stuff
- Look for the first commit *FIRST COMMIT - HOT FIX* to see how to fix the first-time installation problem. Don't ask me why there's a need to do it - because Facebook product is damn buggy. That zz all.

## PDF handling
- `https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-pdf`

## File Viewer && Doc Picker
- `https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-file-viewer`

## Toolbar Android
- `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/toolbar-android`

## Video Player
- `https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-video`
- After this, building on Android might fail with multidex error. Check this link for answers `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49886597/multidex-issue-with-flutter#answer-54680454`
- For custom controls, consider `https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-video-controls`

## Flex Box

## My Custom Video Player:
- Dependencies: 
    + Slider for Progressbar: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/slider`
    + VideoPlayer (as above)
    + SVG icons dependencies : `https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer`. Remember this SVG transformer itself has a handful of dependencies on its own, so remember to npm install all of them. Also, checkout this article for metro configuring the SVG transformer: `https://medium.com/faun/add-custom-svg-icons-to-your-expo-app-279b492f6a15`

- Up-to-now: `VideoComponent`
    + Can customize a video component with different width, height & video URI.
    + Pausing, Replaying and Resuming logic works fine.
    + Users are able to seek different timestamp in the video.
    + The video control elements (The seek bar & Play/Resume/Replay button) are conditionally rendered (Somewhat similar to Youtube videos):
    + Upon playing the video, the video control elements are displayed for 2.5s before disappearing. 
    + While the video is being played, the video control elements are normally hidden. They can be displayed again at any time by tapping the screen, and will linger for 2.5s before disappearing.
    + While the video is paused/ended, the video control elements always appear.
### What's left for this task:
    + Create/Find a SVG icon for the Replay button!
    + Fullscreen mode for video are yet to be implemented. It needs to be considered more carefully since it is connected to navigation, not just simply enlarging the component.

# Next task
- The SVG icon should be able to re-size dynamically.
- Try Sound Component with control? if necessary?
- Why does Video fail while installed?
- Explore other kind of navigators!!
